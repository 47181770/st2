Upgrade Notes
=============

|st2| 0.9dev
------------

* Process names for all |st2| services now start with "st2". sensor_container now runs as
  st2sensorcontainer, rules_engine runs as st2rulesengine, actionrunner now runs as
  st2actionrunner. st2ctl has been updated to handle the name change seamlessly. If you have tools
  that rely on the old process names, upgrade them to use new names.

* All |st2| tools now use "st2" prefix as well. rule_tester is now st2-rule-tester, registercontent
  is now st2-register-content.

* Authentication is now enabled by default for production (package based) deployments. For
  information on how to configure auth, see http://docs.stackstorm.com/install/deploy.html.
