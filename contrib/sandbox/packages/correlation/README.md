Correlation Test Case
=====================

This is a sample use case to test the current system. Please note that this is not optimized. The content here demonstrate the use of an action to correlate events and send a new event (an aggregated event) to the webhook sensor (chaining) when the correlation criteria is met. In this example, the webhook sensor is the same. A second rule is registered to process the aggregated event. In concept the aggregated event could be sent to a different webhook sensor with a different set of triggers, rules, and actions.
