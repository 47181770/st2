        in with-items to throttle the number of action executions that get
        run simultaneously. Currently in this release, the concurrency option
        does not work with YAQL expression.
    type: direct
    input:
        - cmd
        - count
    tasks:
        repeat:
            with-items: i in <% range(0, $.count).list() %>
            concurrency: 2
            action: core.local
            input:
                cmd: "sleep 5; <% $.cmd %>"
            publish:
                result: <% $.repeat.stdout %>
